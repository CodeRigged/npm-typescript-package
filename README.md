## npm-typescript-package

This template can be used to create a new npm package which should follow some standards.

#### Typescript

This template includes typescript, see [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/). Typescript files will compile to js and types (d.ts) in a dist folder.

#### Prettier & ESLint

This template uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) as the default code formatter. I would recommend the [Prettier - Code formatter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) when using VSCode as your default IDE.

It also uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to format your code.


###### Other
Everything is optional, feel free to edit/delete any dependencies and files.
