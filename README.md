## npm-typescript-package

This template can be used to create new npm packages with some set standards.

#### Typescript

Typescript is build on Javascript and is primarily used for catching errors and providing types for your code, see [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/). Typescript files will compile to js and types (d.ts) in a dist folder.

#### Prettier & ESLint

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) are defined as the default code formatter. I would recommend the [Prettier - Code formatter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) when using VSCode as your default IDE.

###### Other
Everything is optional, feel free to edit/delete any dependencies and files.
